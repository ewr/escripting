eGold is the front-end to a content management system I helped write in Sydney at last year's Olympics. It was used on the RealGold site. I'm putting it up here not so much so that it will be useful to you as-is, but because I really like some of the things it does, and you may be able to rip off useful sections.

Files:

* cfg.main - config file
* eGold::core - Module with common routines
* make_gold - main generation script
* random_thumbs - generate thumbnails of random images
* todays_stories - grab headlines for last 30 stories
* make_archives - generate archives
