distort.jpg is a combination of eWorld's camera.jpg web cam software and jwz's vidwhacker script. It takes a snapshot and then applies a random effect to it. Several example effects are provided, and you can add your own using standard image utilities.

The distort.jpg script is available here. Just remove the .txt extension before use.

## u s a g e :
Just call the script like a normal image (ie. `<img src="/cgi-bin/distort.jpg">`). You can get different size images by appending ?size=HHHxVVV (ie. `<img src="/cgi-bin/distort.jpg?size=80x60">`). The default size is 320x240.
