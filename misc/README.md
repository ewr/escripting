The following scripts are too small to warrant their own pages, but we place them here for your perusal.

__split_stereo__

Split a wav file into different files for left and right. I used this to record two mono streams at once.

__pounder__

Spits loads of requests at an authenticated page on a webserver and reports how many times the authentication failed. Mainly just useful if you want to look at the request code, otherwise you're better off using ApacheBench.

__burnbuddy__

Takes an mp3 playlist and uses cdrecord to burn it to cd.

__eQuotes__

Sits on a named pipe spitting quotes out of a quotes files.

__name_grabber__

Seperates names from titles in a file containing one name per line.

__wordilizer__

Picks a given number of words from /usr/dict/words and searchs for them on Altavista, returning the URL to the results if any. I'm pretty sure I took the idea from jwz's webcollage.
