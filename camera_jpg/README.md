Though it looks to all the world like a jpeg image (note the deceptive filename... trickey, eh?), camera.jpg is actually a highly advanced web cam script which snaps a new picture on demand. It is designed to use the streamer utility to capture, but can be adapted to any snapshotting software.

The camera.jpg script is available here. Just remove the .txt extension before use.

## u s a g e :

Just call the script like a normal image (ie. `<img src="/cgi-bin/camera.jpg">`). You can get different size images by appending ?size=HHHxVVV (ie. `<img src="/cgi-bin/camera.jpg?size=80x60">`). The default size is 320x240.
