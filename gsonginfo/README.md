gsonginfo is what I use to put artist and title information on the songs in my 
whatsplaying database. It allows you to view all files, files without info, and 
the last 50 files played. Perhaps the coolest thing about gsonginfo is the 
ObjGTK library, a very nice convenience wrapper for GTK-Perl. ObjGTK takes care 
of all the widget placement and creation issues that normally make Perl-GTK code 
long and boring.

Files:

* gsonginfo - the music info editor
* ObjGTK.pm - the ObjGTK library
