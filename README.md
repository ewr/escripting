_This is an archive of escripting.com, which I used to publish little bits of code to circa 2001 - 2005._

eScripting brings you high quality web-based tools to make your work easier. All scripts are released under the GNU Public License and are freely availible for use and / or modification.

__Misc__

A collection of small scripts that do various things.

__podcast__

A small perl podcast client.

__gsonginfo__

This is the GUI portion of my current song database system. It allows song artists and titles to be edited in the database. It sports another version of ObjGTK, my little GTK convienence wrapper.

__eGold__

eGold is the front-end to a content management system. It does cool template parsing and image thumbnailing.

__eMp3__

eMp3 is a little mp3 player I wrote. It's threaded to allow playlist manipulation while files are playing. It also supports logging files to a SQL database.

__geCam__
geCam is a graphical frontend for taking a picture from Video4Linux and inserting it into a database.

__eCam__

eCam is a webcam platform capable of supporting many cameras. It stores images in a MySQL database, and only uploads sufficiently changed images in order to conserve bandwidth.

__eThreads (Not included here)__

eThreads is a collection of scripts that provide multi-threaded, multi-user, database-driven forums for the World Wide Web. Currently in active development, the scripts are downloadable for use on your servers.

__camera.jpg__

camera.jpg is your standard, run-of-the-mill, no-frills web cam script. It takes a picture and prints it out.

__Distortion Cam__

distort.jpg is a variation of the camera.jpg script. It takes the snapshot and applies a random filter to it, producing weird and sometimes cool results.

__hoserAIMa IM bot__

The hoserAIMa IM bot is a basic bot that uses the AOL instant messenger servers. The bot can communicate with multiple people and store state for all of them. It currently has three 'personalities', and switches between them frequently.
